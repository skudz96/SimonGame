# SimonGame

A fun and interactive browser-based Simon Says game where players match the computer's randomly generated color sequence. As you progress, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging!

## Live Demo:

[Play the Simon Says Game here!](https://skudz96.github.io/SimonGame/)

## Features:

- Randomly generated sequence of colors
- Interactive user input with visual and auditory feedback
- Dynamic level progression
- Game-over functionality with reset capabilities
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the game.
- CSS: Styling and animations for buttons.
- JavaScript: Core game logic, event handling, and interactivity

Note: The HTML and CSS starting files were sourced from [Angela Yu's Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANSGB) JavaScript Workshops. These files were modified and extended to create this interactive Simon Says game. The JavaScript was all written from scratch after revisiting my code from the start of the year, writing notes as pseudocode, and trying to recreate it using docs.

## How to Play:

- Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
- Watch the computer's sequence of colors.
- Click the buttons in the same sequence.
- Progress to the next level if you complete the sequence correctly.
- Game ends if you click the wrong color. How far did you get?
- Feel free to open up the dev tools and see the logs of the correct sequence.
